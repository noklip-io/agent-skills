# Overview and Quick Start

## Install
- `npm install @base-ui/react`
- Base UI ships as a single package with tree-shakable components.

## Portal Isolation
- Wrap the app content in a layout root (for example, `.root`) and set `isolation: isolate` to avoid stacking/context issues with portals.

## iOS 26 Safari Backdrop
- If you use backdrop-based components, set `body { position: relative; }`.

## Project Context
- Base UI is unstyled and accessible by default.
- It is created by the teams behind Radix, Material UI, and Floating UI.

## LLM Docs Access
- Use `.md` versions of Base UI docs for clean Markdown.
- Use `https://base-ui.com/react/llms.txt` for the full list of docs.
